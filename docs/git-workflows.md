# Guidelines for Git and GitHub Workflows
In this series of documents, we present what we consider best practices for executing data science projects. Itâ€™s important to note that these practices are tailored specifically to the work of the <span style="color:#3EACAD">Data Lab</span>. While they may not be universally applicable to all data science projects, we believe they remain highly valuable. 

These documents will cover the following topics:


1.**Folder Structure and Naming Conventions for Project Setup**

2. **Git and GitHub Workflow Standards and Guidelines**

3.**Standards for Documenting and Styling Analytical Notebooks**

4.**Guidelines for Communicating and Presenting Data Outputs.**
