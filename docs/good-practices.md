# Recommended Workflows for Data Science Project
In this series of documents, we present what we consider best practices for executing data science projects. Itâ€™s important to note that these practices are tailored specifically to the work of the <span style="color:#3EACAD">Data Lab</span>. While they may not be universally applicable to all data science projects, we believe they remain highly valuable.

1.**Git and GitHub Workflow Standards and Guidelines**

2.**Guidelines for Communicating and Presenting Data Outputs.**

3.**Standards for Documenting and Styling Analytical Notebooks**
